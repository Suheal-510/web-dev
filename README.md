CODE REVIEW :
HTML Structure:

A form where users enter new tasks and click the "ADD TASK" button.

Two sections: "Tasks List" (for pending tasks) and "Tasks Done" (for completed ones).

CSS Styling (Not Shown in Code, But Included in to-do.css):

Styles the form, buttons, and task display.

Gives a clean and structured layout.

JavaScript Functionality (main.js):

Event Listener on Page Load: Ensures the script runs after the page loads.

Task Creation:

When a user submits a task, a new task element is created.

The task is displayed inside a div with buttons for Edit, Delete, and DONE.

Edit Task:

Clicking "Edit" allows users to modify the task.

Clicking "Save" makes it read-only again.

Delete Task:

Removes the task from the list when the "Delete" button is clicked.

Mark as Done:

Moves the task to the "Tasks Done" section when "DONE" is clicked.
